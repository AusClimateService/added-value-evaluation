# Meeting Notes
- Update from everyone:
  - Chun-Hsu on coarse resolution AV
  - Ben on progress with CCAM
  - Christian on prgoress with BARPA
  - Emma on nat
 
- Coarsening RCM is benefitial because of ...:
  - What coarsening method to use:
  - Upscaling to GCM resolution (at 1.5deg):
    - Could be applied to RAV too
    - Easy to do
  - Collapsing spatial dimension for sub regions:
    - For a sub region sort values and compare GCM, RCM and obs
    - Looses spatial information
    - Only possible for sub regions
    - Could be applied to RAV too
  - Convolution approach:
    - Similar to upscaling to 1.5deg resolution
    - Smoothing of field
  - Native grid added value:
    - Problematic for precipitation especially for high percentiles
    - Maybe do a case study (Eastern Aus, or Snowy - https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04736-x)
- Next steps:
  - Emma to write spatial ranked added value into a function
  - Christian to test convolution method and compare upscaled method
  - Christian to use lib_spatial to upscale RCM to 1.5deg (upscale first then percentile) - add this functionality to code
