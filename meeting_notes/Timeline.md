# Meeting notes
- Common directory: /g/data/tp28/ACS_added_value/
- Common directory for CCAM: /g/data/xv83/users/bxn599/ACS/added-value-evaluation-analysis/
- List of climate indicies:
  - CDD
  - Days above 25deg - Ben to check with Damien about different threshold (e.g., 30deg or 35deg) - Christian to ask Mitch about what threshold to use.
  - excess heat factor (probably not)
- We do not include NarClim
- Compare to Sarah's paper - Happy to go forward with our method - ACS is hazard focused.
