# Updates and discussions
* Wind station data available (Chun-Hsu)
* PAV code added (Thanks to Chun-Hsu)
* RAV code and variability code available
* Have to improve on plotting scripts (e.g., heat maps)
  * Add to lib standards
* What metric to start with?
  * Start with mean squared error map plots
* What quantiles to choose?
  * mean, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99, 0.1
  * Extreme quantiles might not make sense for some measure (e.g., CDD)
* What time period to choose?
  * Use time periods defined in CCAM evaluation: https://github.com/AusClimateService/ccam-evaluation/blob/main/evaluation_standards.md 
* What scenarios (ssp126, ssp370)?
  * Start with SSP370 but eventually do both
* What indices to use for heatwave?
  * Ben to get in touch with Mitch next week.
* How we go about producing results / next steps?
  * Christian to produce some results by next meeting for BARPA and CCAM Far future, 0.99. Get usable template:
    * Get scripts ready for Raj to use. 
    * Could be shell script
    * Distribute bash script to Chun-Hsu, Emma and Ben.
    * Ben to repeat this for icclim indices (e.g., CDD)
  * Emma to check how to implement station based data (wind and rain gauge) into scripts
* Check masking (e.g., lib_spatial) â€“ Follow ccam evaluation standards.
* Start analysis for NorESM ssp370, as this is available for CCAM and BARPA

# Issues and errors
* Plotting issues for different conda environments
  * 22.01 is working fine other conda env have issues.
