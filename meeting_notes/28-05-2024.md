# Meeting notes 

- Discussed Chun-Hsu's results with 1.5deg resolution and agreed they are looking better than RCM resolution results.
- Potentially CCAM has lower added value in larger scale due to spectral nudging.
- Updates:
  - Christian added upscaling to GCM and reference grid(e.g., 1.5deg) to the code
    - Found issues with xarray dropping NaN values which makes the result look strange. Try and fix issue. Try visualising with matplotlib instead of ncview.
    - Join lp01 and get reference grid from their upscaled files.
  - Emma added Perkins Skill Score
  - Ben calculated days above X
