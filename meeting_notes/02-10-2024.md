# Meeting notes
- Progress to date
  - CHS and BN have added to google docs
  - EH and CST added new plots
 - To do
   - Extend GCM length scale to CDD, CWD, TNn, RX1day, TXgt40, TXx
   - How do we do this?
     - Mean!
     - AVse(mean(CDD_BARPA, "time"), mean(CDD_AGCD, "time"))
   - Can we add a "significance" outline to the PSS plots?
     - Maybe AV fraction on RCM grid
   - CST: Test topography and coastline mask on 1.5deg data
   - CESM2 is missing in BARPA
   - Make naming consistent with evaluation paper
 - Very good momentum currently
