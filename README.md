# added-value-evaluation
Added value analysis (e.g., added value, potential added value, realised added value) for BARPA and CCAM.

# ToDo

1. Write a script that can calculate added value - InProgress 
2. Write a script that can calculate potential added value – Not started (can build of AV script above) - CHS 
3. Write a script that can calculate realised added value – Not started (can build of AV script above)  - CST 
4. Think about process (and ACS hazard focused) based added values - ToDo: 
  * Extreme rainfall (AGCD + gauges) - EH looks at gauges, CST at AGCD 
  * Extreme temperatures - CST 
  * Heatwaves (find icclim index) - Ben 
  * Consecutive dry days - Ben 
  * Wind extremes - CHS 
  * Spatial/temporal autocorrelation/structure of rainfall 
  * Bushfire (FFDI) 
5. Also implement the hazard focused AVs in added value library 
6. Do a literature review and write an introduction 
7. Calculate AV, PAV, RAV for all RCM downscaling combinations (e.g., BARPA-ERA5, CCAM-ERA5, BARPA-ACCESS-CM2, CCAM-ACCESS-CM2, …) 
8. Plot, maps, heatmaps, scorecard style (over NRM regions) or other summary plots
